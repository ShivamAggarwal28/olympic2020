        <p class="others-content">
          In January 2020, concerns were raised about the potential impact of
          the COVID-19 pandemic on athletes and visitors to the Olympic Games.
          Tokyo organizers insisted they were monitoring the spread of the
          disease to minimize its effects on preparations for the Olympics.
          Unlike the case for Zika virus during the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio
          de Janeiro, SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted directly between humans,
          posing tougher challenges for the organizers to counteract the
          infectious disease and host a safe and secure event.

          the women's basketball qualification was played in Belgrade, Serbia,
          instead of Foshan, China. The Asia & Oceania boxing qualification
          tournament, which was originally planned to be held from 3â€“14 February
          in Wuhan, China (the location of the original outbreak of the COVID-19
          pandemic), instead took place in Amman, Jordan, at the beginning of
          March. The third round of the women's football qualification
          tournament was also affected, as the group matches formerly scheduled
          to be held in China were moved to Australia. The European boxing
          qualification began on 14 March 2020 in London, United Kingdom, but
          was suspended after two days of competition before being rescheduled
          for April 2021. It eventually resumed in June 2021 but was moved to
          Paris, France.

          Mandatory doping tests were being severely restricted by the COVID-19
          pandemic in early 2020. European anti-doping organizations raised
          concerns that blood and urine tests could not be performed and that
          mobilizing the staff necessary to do so before the end of the pandemic
          would be a health risk. Despite the need for extensive testing to take
          place in advance of the Games, the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA)
          stated that public health and safety were their topmost priorities.
          The Chinese anti-doping agency temporarily ceased testing on 3
          February 2020, with a planned resumption of phased testing towards the
          end of the month.
